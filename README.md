# Description
The aim of the work was to refactor the code so that the code follows **accessibility** standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

# Work-flow
1. Removed *div* tags with semantic HTML
2. Make sure that links are working
3. Changed h2,h3 tags to h1
4. Consolidated elements related to *main* section
5. Consolidated elements related to *aside* section
6. Removed *ids* and used semantic tags or classes to address elements in css unless required for links
